## Practicing simple tasks to learn and understand React hooks.
I'm studying with [this theory playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnrYvsBdtD8&list=PLovN13bqAx7CKHNJnW3npFEXlXUQBghNI) and completing [tasks](https://github.com/Nooder/react-in-depth) from GitHub.

Solutions are organized by folders for each hook, such as `useState_ex`. Each folder contains tasks and their solutions divided into subfolders.

Although the original approach suggests creating a new project for each task, Iâ€™m managing everything within a single project by connecting and testing the relevant components.
